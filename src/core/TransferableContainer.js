	 *
	 * The `Transferable` interface represents an object that can be transfered
	 * between different execution contexts, like the main thread and Web Workers.
	 *
	 * @example
	 * `Worker.postMessage()` takes an optional array of `Transferable` objects to
	 * transfer ownership of. If the ownership of an object is transferred, it
	 * becomes unusable (neutered) in the context it was sent from and becomes
	 * available only to the worker it was sent to. `Transferable` objects are
	 * instances of classes like `ArrayBuffer`, `MessagePort` or `ImageBitmap`.
	 *
	 * @throws {Error} An error is thrown if the method is not overridden.
	 * @param {Array} [transferList] - An existing list that the transferable items should be added to.
	 * @return {Transferable[]} The transfer list. Null is not an acceptable value for the transferList.
